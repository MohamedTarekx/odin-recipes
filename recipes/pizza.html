    <p>Make this homemade pizza with basic ingredients, then top it with any of your favorite toppings.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) envelope active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup lukewarm water</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons shortening</li>
        <li>Â¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Make the dough: Dissolve yeast in lukewarm water in a small bowl. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, shortening, and salt in a large bowl; add yeast mixture and stir until dough comes together. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Lightly oil a large bowl. Place dough into the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Roll each half into a 12-inch circle. Place dough onto two 12-inch pizza pans; cover with sauce and mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crusts are golden brown, about 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    <strong>That's all. Enjoy!</strong>
